##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series: Crypto & Blockchain – A New Frontier in Taxation**
**5 June**

Tax Academy is pleased to organise the webinar on “Taxation of Crypto & Blockchain Tokens”. The webinar will be conducted by Mr Sam Sim, Board member Tax Analysts and Mr Irving Aw, both co-founders of Taxise Asia LLC.

According to Tracxn, there are 398 Blockchain startups in Singapore as of April 2020. Financial technology (fintech) companies in Singapore raised a record US$735 million (S$1 billion) in the first nine months of 2019 according to Accenture. Given the growing importance of the crypto industry, a number of jurisdictions have in the past two years offered guidance on the tax treatment of crypto assets to provide more clarity and certainty to taxpayers. This includes Singapore, where IRAS has in recent times issued e-Tax Guides on the income tax and GST treatment of digital tokens. However, tax policy responses continue to evolve largely due to the versatility and non-monolithic nature of crypto assets as an asset class, as well as the evolving ways in which they are being put to commercial application.

Join us in this introductory class which will uncover the exciting world of taxation in this cutting edge industry. This webinar will provide participants with an overview of the common types of crypto assets, including stablecoins, that are currently in the market. The manner in which jurisdictions have sought to tax transactions involving these types of crypto assets, from both direct tax and indirect tax perspectives, as well as some of the cross-border tax challenges presented due to the lack of a uniform approach by jurisdictions on the tax classification of these assets, will also be discussed.

This webinar is suitable for: Tax practitioners, business owners, finance, accounting and legal professionals

**Administrative Details**

* Date: 5 Jun 20 (Fri)
* Time: 3.00 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.

* [Registration Form](https://forms.gle/Qgv8wzPVzJ4GSoaCA)
