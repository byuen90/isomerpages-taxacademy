##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series – Transfer Pricing for Financial Transactions**
**29 July**

The OECD’s Guidance on Financial Transactions was finally released in February 2020 to the much awaited relief of taxpayers, given the current economic situation that has come about due to COVID-19.  While the guidance provides specific considerations for intercompany lending, it also expands on the role and analysis of the treasury functions by looking at transactions involving hedging, cash pooling and financial guarantees.  Furthermore, it also provides detailed guidance on how arm’s length pricing for captive insurance and re-insurance should be undertaken. 
 
This is a significant step by the OECD towards providing an all-inclusive guidance on financial transactions, and clearly signifies that the OECD expects to see marked progress by multinationals in updating their existing transfer pricing policies on financial transactions to comply with the updated Transfer Pricing Guidelines.  Such guidance is also likely to provide the necessary framework for tax authorities to review their related party financial transactions.
 
The webinar will be presented by **Dr. Sowmya Varadharajan (Director, IC Advisors Pte. Ltd.)**, where she will share her views and insights on financial transactions’ transfer pricing considerations for multinationals, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
 
Who Should Attend: Business Leaders / Owners, Finance, Accounting, Legal Professionals, Tax Practitioners

##### **Permanent Establishment post BEPS in a digitalized world for Singapore and Singapore companies operating in the region**
**24 July**

At the end of January 2020, the OECD Inclusive Framework (IF) on BEPS released a statement on its ongoing work to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. In this statement, the BEPS IF reaffirmed their commitment to reaching a multilateral solution by the end of 2020. In particular, the Pillar 1 proposal is intended to ensure a right to taxation in the market jurisdictions in relation to digital businesses and other consumer facing businesses that generate revenue through an active and sustained engagement in the market. There remains significant political challenges in achieving consensus at the OECD level, but if agreed, Pillar 1 would represent the most significant change to the international tax framework in over 100 years.

This webinar will be presented by speakers from Deloitte & Touche LLP, **Mr Rohan Solapurkar (Partner, Tax, Deloitte & Touche LLP) and Ms Krisma Bhalla (Director, International Tax)**, where they will discuss the potential impact of the proposal on Singapore businesses, discussion topics include:

* an overview of the background and status of discussions at the OECD level for a digital PE (i.e. the Pillar 1 proposal);
* the outline of the Pillar 1 proposal and the key on-going work; and
* key practical considerations for Singapore businesses with regard to the potential impact of the Pillar 1 proposal.

##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series – China Tax Update**
**23 July**

The global economic slowdown, China-US trade tensions and other factors have exerted pressure on China’s economic growth in 2019. To boost the economic development and maintain stable growth, China had relied on high-standard opening up, propelled innovation in 2019. In the tax front, China had reduced taxes and fees on a large scale. Tax reforms, covering the steadily advancing IIT reform, the deepening VAT reform  and the accelerating all-round tax legislation and the supportive fiscal and tax policies in special economic development areas covering the Greater Bay Area were the driving force in the 2019 tax policy.

At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 has swept across the country. In order to deal with the epidemic and support the economy, fiscal and tax authorities issued support policies to fight against the epidemic within a short period of time. Facing the world, China is on the tiptoe of expectation that how it will participate in setting up the landscape of global tax governance against the backdrop of BEPS 2.0 to give play to its wisdom amongst new challenges. It has extended VAT incentives for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreak.
