##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series: Managing Tax Controversies in the New Normal**
**13 Aug**

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is known to adopt a risk-based approach in reviewing the income tax returns of companies. According to the IRAS’ website, around 90% of the corporate tax returns filed are classified as “companies with straightforward affairs” while the remaining 10% are from “companies with complex affairs”. Companies with straightforward tax affairs generally do not require detailed reviews of their income tax returns on a year-to-year basis. On the other hand, companies with more complex tax affairs can expect more in-depth reviews of their yearly income tax returns. How confident are you in managing your corporate income tax issues with the IRAS? Has the COVID-19 pandemic given rise to new tax audit issues and increased the likelihood of tax audits for companies?

Join **Mrs Chung-Sim Siew Moon (Asia-Pacific Tax Policy and Controversy Leader and  Partner, Tax Services) from Ernst & Young Solutions LLP**, who will share with you the current corporate tax audit landscape in Singapore, and what you can do to proactively prevent controversy, manage risks and resolve disputes with the IRAS. You will also learn more about how businesses can put in place a proper documented tax governance framework to minimise potential tax controversy and tax uncertainty, and avoid costly mistakes.

##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series – Transfer Pricing for Financial Transactions**
**29 Jul**

The OECD’s Guidance on Financial Transactions was finally released in February 2020 to the much awaited relief of taxpayers, given the current economic situation that has come about due to COVID-19.  While the guidance provides specific considerations for intercompany lending, it also expands on the role and analysis of the treasury functions by looking at transactions involving hedging, cash pooling and financial guarantees.  Furthermore, it also provides detailed guidance on how arm’s length pricing for captive insurance and re-insurance should be undertaken. 
 
This is a significant step by the OECD towards providing an all-inclusive guidance on financial transactions, and clearly signifies that the OECD expects to see marked progress by multinationals in updating their existing transfer pricing policies on financial transactions to comply with the updated Transfer Pricing Guidelines.  Such guidance is also likely to provide the necessary framework for tax authorities to review their related party financial transactions.
 
The webinar will be presented by **Dr. Sowmya Varadharajan (Director, IC Advisors Pte. Ltd.)**, where she will share her views and insights on financial transactions’ transfer pricing considerations for multinationals, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
 
Who Should Attend: Business Leaders / Owners, Finance, Accounting, Legal Professionals, Tax Practitioners

In particular, the Pillar 1 proposal is intended to ensure a right to taxation in the market jurisdictions in relation to digital businesses and other consumer facing businesses that generate revenue through an active and sustained engagement in the market.

##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series – China Tax Update**
**23 Jul**

The global economic slowdown, China-US trade tensions and other factors have exerted pressure on China’s economic growth in 2019. To boost the economic development and maintain stable growth, China had relied on high-standard opening up, propelled innovation in 2019. In the tax front, China had reduced taxes and fees on a large scale. Tax reforms, covering the steadily advancing IIT reform, the deepening VAT reform  and the accelerating all-round tax legislation and the supportive fiscal and tax policies in special economic development areas covering the Greater Bay Area were the driving force in the 2019 tax policy.

At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 has swept across the country. In order to deal with the epidemic and support the economy, fiscal and tax authorities issued support policies to fight against the epidemic within a short period of time. Facing the world, China is on the tiptoe of expectation that how it will participate in setting up the landscape of global tax governance against the backdrop of BEPS 2.0 to give play to its wisdom amongst new challenges. It has extended VAT incentives for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreak.
