##### **TaxEdge Webinar Series: Managing Tax Controversies in the New Normal**
**13 Aug**

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is known to adopt a risk-based approach in reviewing the income tax returns of companies. According to the IRAS’ website, around 90% of the corporate tax returns filed are classified as “companies with straightforward affairs” while the remaining 10% are from “companies with complex affairs”. Companies with straightforward tax affairs generally do not require detailed reviews of their income tax returns on a year-to-year basis. On the other hand, companies with more complex tax affairs can expect more in-depth reviews of their yearly income tax returns. How confident are you in managing your corporate income tax issues with the IRAS? Has the COVID-19 pandemic given rise to new tax audit issues and increased the likelihood of tax audits for companies?

Join **Mrs Chung-Sim Siew Moon (Asia-Pacific Tax Policy and Controversy Leader and  Partner, Tax Services) from Ernst & Young Solutions LLP**, who will share with you the current corporate tax audit landscape in Singapore, and what you can do to proactively prevent controversy, manage risks and resolve disputes with the IRAS. You will also learn more about how businesses can put in place a proper documented tax governance framework to minimise potential tax controversy and tax uncertainty, and avoid costly mistakes.
