"The programme provided good insights into transfer pricing developments, with content that was current and relevant, and helped to draw out key issues for discussion. I especially appreciated that the speakers were able to deliver a mix of perspectives from academia, practitioner as well as private sector angles."
Ms Jilian Lim
Executive Director, Singapore Economic Development Board

"A very well-organised and comprehensive course, covering the technical aspects of transfer pricing in a post-BEPS world, complemented with great presentations by experts from academia and private practice, with ample opportunities to discuss ideas and concepts with fellow practitioners. A thoroughly enjoyable experience. Thank you again, Vienna University of Economics and Business and Tax Academy of Singapore!"
